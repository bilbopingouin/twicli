# twicli

twicli is a basic twitter client for multi-twitter accounts and for use in command-line

After downloading the client, you need to register an application with twitter (API) and write the token into `data/token`.

Then make authorisation token to connect to your twitter account(s), and save them into `data/oauth`.

That's it, just run 

   ./read_tweets.py --all
